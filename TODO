Figure out how treesitter starts automatically
Put gruvbox in a colors dir
Difftool with nvim server
Have a nvim solution for :h terminal-osc7 instead of zshrc
Contribute to treesitter parser for vimscript since it sucks for `%substitue///`
Add LaTeX compiler support, look into filetype/ and compiler/ in :h rtp
